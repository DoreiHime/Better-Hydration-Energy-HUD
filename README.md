About this mod:

At the water/food “rings,” show two lines:
Top: Amount needed to fill (difference)
Bottom: Current value / Max value (integers, spaced)
Per-item controls for X/Y offsets and font size.

No dependency on other mods, does not modify game UI assets, resolution-adaptive; auto high/low refresh with very low performance cost.

How to Switch Languages
English is the default—no action needed. For Chinese, replace the file as follows:
Open this mod’s folder (path above).
Go to the language subfolder and pick the language you want (e.g., zh, en).
Copy that folder’s BetterHydrationEnergyHUD.dll into the mod’s root folder (overwrite the file with the same name).
Start the game and reload the mod.

Note: Steam Workshop updates may overwrite your replaced DLL. If the language reverts, please repeat the steps above.

Compatibility
No known issues reported yet.
Possible case: if another mod fully replaces the game’s HUDCanvas or hides the ring icons, the numbers may not anchor to the correct position.

FAQ
Can’t see the numbers: Make sure the mod is enabled. Load into a save → press F10 to open settings → click Reset, then try again.
Panel doesn’t fit on low resolutions: The panel supports scrolling—use the mouse wheel.
Only want the top or bottom line: In settings, toggle the respective Show option.
“0 100/100” on a black screen when entering/exiting scenes: I’m working on this--please ignore it for now… I’m doing my best!

P.S. Thanks for all the support—you’re the reason I keep improving this mod. From a simple value display to adjustable settings and multilingual support, we’ve built this together. Love you all ♥
